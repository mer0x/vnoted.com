Rich media content, heavy JavaScript frameworks, bloated websites, and increasing demands on system memory have turned older computers into obsolete machines that struggle even with basic browsing tasks. While technology inevitably marches forward, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand why this happens and what we, as users and developers, can do to breathe new life into older hardware. In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how and why modern web browsing is becoming difficult for aging systems, and we\u0026rsquo;ll provide practical steps and tools to make your older PC usable again.\nWhy is the Internet Slowing Down Old PCs? In the early days of the web, most websites consisted of plain HTML pages with minimal JavaScript and CSS. Over time, we\u0026rsquo;ve moved toward feature-rich web applications built on heavy frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue. These modern websites often load large assets, high-resolution images, videos, and execute complex scripts—all of which require more CPU power, RAM, and fast storage.\nOlder computers—those built 10 or more years ago—typically have fewer CPU cores, less RAM, slower disk drives, and outdated graphics processing capabilities. As a result, they struggle to handle the resource-intensive tasks of modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.\nStep 1: Check Your Hardware\u0026rsquo;s Current Condition Before taking further steps, it\u0026rsquo;s important to assess your hardware\u0026rsquo;s current state and limitations.\nWindows Users: Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. Navigate to the Performance tab and note CPU usage, Memory usage, and Disk activity. Linux Users: Open a terminal and run: top This command gives you a real-time overview of CPU and memory usage. macOS Users: Open Activity Monitor from the Applications/Utilities folder and review CPU, Memory, and Disk tabs. If you find your CPU consistently near 100%, memory often maxed out, or your disk performance slow, your hardware is struggling with modern web applications.\nStep 2: Choose a Lighter Browser Modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox are resource-intensive. However, there are alternatives designed specifically for older hardware:\nPale Moon: A lightweight, open-source browser forked from Firefox, optimized for older hardware. Midori: A minimalistic browser ideal for systems with limited resources. Falkon: A KDE lightweight browser suitable for older hardware and Linux distributions. Installing Pale Moon (Example for Windows): Visit the official Pale Moon website. Download the installer suitable for your operating system. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Pale Moon. Launch Pale Moon and import bookmarks and preferences from your previous browser if needed. Installing Falkon (Example for Ubuntu Linux): sudo apt update sudo apt install falkon Step 3: Block Ads and Unnecessary Scripts Ads and trackers drastically increase the load on your CPU and memory. Installing ad-blocking extensions can reduce these burdens:\nuBlock Origin: An efficient ad-blocker that reduces resource consumption. NoScript (Firefox-based browsers): Blocks JavaScript execution by default, letting you selectively enable it only on trusted websites. Installing uBlock Origin on Pale Moon: Visit the uBlock Origin for Pale Moon page. Click Add to Pale Moon. Restart the browser to activate. Configuring NoScript: Once installed, NoScript blocks JavaScript by default. Allow scripts selectively by clicking the NoScript icon and enabling trusted sites. Step 4: Use Lightweight Operating Systems Sometimes the operating system itself contributes significantly to resource usage. Consider installing lightweight Linux distributions designed for older hardware:\nLubuntu: Ubuntu-based, lightweight, friendly for beginners. Linux Mint XFCE: Easy to use, very efficient on older machines. Puppy Linux: Extremely lightweight, runs effectively even on very old hardware. Example: Installing Lubuntu Download Lubuntu ISO from the official Lubuntu website. Create a bootable USB stick using tools like Rufus (Windows) or dd command (Linux/macOS). Boot your PC from the USB stick and follow the installation wizard. Step 5: Optimize Browser Settings for Better Performance Adjusting browser settings can also make a noticeable difference:\nDisable Hardware Acceleration: Older GPUs sometimes struggle with hardware acceleration. Disabling it can actually improve performance.\nIn Firefox/Pale Moon: Go to Preferences \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Performance and uncheck \u0026ldquo;Use recommended performance settings\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Use hardware acceleration when available\u0026rdquo;. Limit Open Tabs: Keep your tabs to a minimum to reduce memory usage. Use bookmarks or session managers instead.\nAvoid Heavy Websites: Use lightweight alternatives (e.g., mobile versions or alternative lightweight web services).\nOptional: Reduce System Overhead Disable unnecessary startup programs: In Windows, use Task Manager Startup tab. In Linux, remove unnecessary services using systemctl. Upgrade hardware (if possible): Simple upgrades like adding more RAM or replacing an HDD with an SSD can significantly improve performance on older PCs. Example: Disabling Unnecessary Startup Services on Linux sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service sudo systemctl disable cups.service # if you don\u0026#39;t need printing sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service Disabling services you don\u0026rsquo;t regularly use frees up valuable resources.\nConclusion: Breathing Life Back into Your Old PC The modern internet landscape does pose significant challenges for older PC hardware. However, by adopting lightweight browsers, blocking unnecessary scripts and ads, switching to more efficient operating systems, and optimizing your settings, you can extend the usable lifespan of your old machine considerably.\nNot only does this save you money, but it also reduces electronic waste, benefiting both your wallet and the environment. While the internet\u0026rsquo;s complexity will continue to grow, understanding these strategies can help you stay productive even on hardware that seems past its prime.\n**\n","permalink":"https://vnoted.com/posts/how-the-modern-internet-is-killing-old-pc-hardwareand-how-you-can-fight-back/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe internet we use today is vastly different from a decade ago.

Whether you\u0026rsquo;re developing a small web app, a personal blog, or experimenting with new frameworks, automating builds, tests, and deployments saves time, reduces errors, and improves your project quality.\nIn this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through setting up a straightforward CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, a popular and accessible platform for hobbyists. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover essential concepts clearly and provide practical examples to help you get started quickly.\nWhy CI/CD Matters for Hobby Projects CI/CD automates repetitive tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your code. Even in small personal projects, automation provides significant benefits:\nImproved Code Quality: Regular automated testing ensures fewer bugs. Faster Feedback Loops: Quickly identify and fix issues as they arise. Easy Deployments: Automate deployments to cloud providers or hosting services. Learning Opportunity: Gain valuable experience with industry-standard practices and tools. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into setting up a basic pipeline with GitHub Actions.\nPrerequisites Before starting, ensure you have:\nA GitHub account A repository containing your hobbyist project (Node.js, Python, or another programming language) Basic familiarity with Git and version control practices Step-by-Step Guide to Building a CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions We\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate a simple pipeline using a Node.js application as an example, but the principles apply similarly to other languages or frameworks.\nStep 1: Prepare Your Project Repository First, ensure your project repository is hosted on GitHub. If it\u0026rsquo;s not already on GitHub, create a new repository and push your existing code:\ngit init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git git push -u origin main Replace your-username and your-repo with your actual GitHub username and repository name.\nStep 2: Creating a GitHub Actions Workflow GitHub Actions workflows are defined by YAML files stored in .github/workflows/ directory within your project repository.\nCreate a file named .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml inside your repository with the following content:\nname: Node.js CI/CD Pipeline on: push: branches: - main pull_request: branches: - main jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout Repository uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Set up Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v3 with: node-version: \u0026#39;20\u0026#39; - name: Install Dependencies run: npm install - name: Run Tests run: npm test - name: Build Project run: npm run build # Optional deployment step # Uncomment and configure if deploying to services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or AWS # - name: Deploy Project # run: | # your deployment commands here Explanation:\nThe workflow triggers on commits (push) and pull requests (pull_request) targeting the main branch. It runs on a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu environment (ubuntu-latest). Steps include checking out the repository, setting up Node.js, installing dependencies, running tests, and building the project. The optional deployment step can be customized depending on your hosting provider or deployment strategy. Step 3: Commit and Push Your Workflow File Save the file, then commit and push it to your repository:\ngit add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml git commit -m \u0026#34;Add initial CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions\u0026#34; git push origin main GitHub Actions will automatically detect the workflow file and start running your CI/CD pipeline.\nStep 4: Monitoring Your Pipeline Navigate to your GitHub repository and click on the Actions tab. Here, you will see workflow runs triggered by your commits and pull requests.\nEach run provides detailed logs to help you debug failures and monitor your pipeline\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nCustomizing Your CI/CD Pipeline Depending on your project needs, you might want to enhance your pipeline further:\nAdding Linting and Code Quality Tools You can integrate linting tools such as ESLint or Prettier for JavaScript projects or Flake8 for Python projects.\nExample Node.js linting step:\n- name: Lint Code run: npm run lint Deploying Your Project Automatically If you want to deploy your project automatically after successful builds, you can add deployment steps. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of deploying to GitHub Pages:\n- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./dist Make sure to replace ./dist with your project\u0026rsquo;s actual build directory.\nBest Practices and Tips Keep Workflows Simple Initially: Start simple, then gradually add complexity as your needs evolve. Secure Sensitive Information: Store sensitive data (API keys, passwords) securely using GitHub Secrets. Regularly Update Dependencies: Keeping dependencies updated reduces security vulnerabilities and improves reliability. Set Up Notifications: Configure email or Slack notifications to alert you of build failures immediately. Conclusion CI/CD pipelines aren\u0026rsquo;t just for professional development teams—they\u0026rsquo;re a valuable tool for hobbyists looking to improve code quality and streamline their development process. By using GitHub Actions, you can easily automate testing, building, and even deployment, giving you more time to focus on building and experimenting with your project.\nIn this guide, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned:\nWhy CI/CD is beneficial even for small hobby projects.
